Project 2: Blinky-Buzzy Toy
===========================

## Description:
This interrupt-driven program flashes the LEDs, and plays buzzing sounds in a
silly pattern. Depending on what button you press (On the green board), a
different action will happen!

## Button Functions:
On the green board, there are four buttons. On top, you can see each button is
labeled S1-S4 going from left to right. The following descriptions will use
this naming convention for the buttons.

- Pressing **S1**: This button will make a tune play. This song is the opening
    theme of Sonic The Hedgehog! Notice how the red and green led turn on and
    alternate when there is a break in between notes.

- Pressing **S2**: This button will make a siren pattern play. The siren is
  also a mini rhythm game! If you press S3 right when the siren displays the
  green LED, when you press S2 again, the siren's pitch will
  increase. Similarly, if you press S3 right when the siren displays the
  red LED, when you press S2 again, the siren's pitch will decrease. 

- Pressing **S3**: This button turns off the buzzer, and causes only the green
  LED to turn on.

- Pressing **S4**: This button turns off the buzzer, and makes de red LED turn
  on with different dim intensities.
